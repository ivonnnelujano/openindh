# What Would it Take?

When it comes to promoting the importance of open scholarship, Latin America and the Caribbean stand out in the sense that the concept of “openness” is generally accepted in the the region. Several nations, such as Peru, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, have shown real advances in terms of national laws that seek to make knowledge produced with public funds a common good managed by the academic community. Regional projects such as [Scielo](http://www.scielo.org/php/index.php) and [redalyc.org](http://www.redalyc.org/) have played a unique role in making scholarship published in Ibero American and Latin American journals available free of charge. 

### In Latin America and the Caribbean, open access is established as the most impactful academic communication model, giving visibility and value to scientific production at a regional and global level. 

Nevertheless, the question remains:  **to what extent has this environment influenced the work of digital humanists in Latin America, the Caribbean, and beyond?** Much of the most well-known digital humanities (DH) work tends to focus myopically on projects coming out of North America and Western Europe.  Projects like [Around DH](http://www.arounddh.org/) that focus on the global scene remain an exception. Moreover, despite efforts by groups such as [Global Outlook::Digital Humanities (GO::DH)](http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/) and the [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations](https://adho.org/), DH remains a very English-language-centric interdiscipline. 

**What would it take to bring DH into a more global openness model**, not only in terms of access but also in terms of methods, best practices and opportunities for collaboration? And what could this openness look like set against the backdrop of the long-standing and highly developed open access movement of Latin America and the Caribbean?

[This workshop](https://dh2018.adho.org/en/talleres/) will analyse these challenges by highlighting existing initiatives and exploring possibilities to advance open in DH in Latin America and the Caribbean. We will begin by examining national laws and specific case studies that illustrate the approaches, progress, and challenges of open access as a movement in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as the global context. The workshop will then shift to focus on the ways these various infrastructures for open can be deployed to build a more globally open DH. 

Please join us for **Where is the Open in DH? on Tuesday 26, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.**, at the Empire Room A, Sheraton María Isabel Hotel, as part of the [Digital Humanities Conference](https://dh2018.adho.org/) in Mexico City, from June 26-29.

We are currently peparing a final schedule for the workshop and a list of supporing resources.  We welcome reading and case study examples from attendees and anyone interested in the topics we'll be exploring.  Please review our [orrientation page](https://github.com/rchampieux/openindh/blob/master/_resources/orientation.md) to submit your ideas.
